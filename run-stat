#
#  Synopsis:
#	Summarize stats and duration in run/{flowd,bio4d}.{pid,stat} files.
#  Description:
#	Summarize the overall message flow by converting the contents of
#	status files in the directory
#
#		run/{flowd,bio4d}.{pid,stat}
#
#	to tab separated rows, suitable for parsing by shell scripts.  The
#	processes summarized are "bio4d" and "flowd", typically in either
#	directories ${BLOBIO_ROOT, SETSPACE_ROOT}/<schema>/*/run or
#	$BLOBIO_ROOT/sync/<host>/run.
#
#	run-stat writes tab separated rows to standard out.
#
#		[bio4d|flowd] [UP|DOWN|ZOMBIE] <up-epoch>		\
#			<boot-ok> <boot-fail> 				\
#			<sample-ok> <sample-fail>
#
#	<boot> stats are since process start and <sample> is the most recent
#	sample stat, typically within 10 seconds.
#
#	<ok> is the total number correct requests, <fail> is the total number of
#	requests, possibly needing attention.
#
#	For bio4d, <fail> sums mundane client errors, timeouts, signals and
#	server-side panics. <ok> sums all syntactally correct requests by
#	clients, including requests for non-existant blobs.
#
#	For flowd, the stats sum the columns in the *.fdr records.  <ok>
#	is the sum of both process (exit code) and query execution (SQLSTATE)
#	status codes.  Typically, <ok> for a process (*.xdr) is the exit status
#	0, although the meaning of "OK" can be overridden in the etc/*.flow
#	file. Similary for sql queries, "OK" can be extened from "00000" to
#	other codes.  The <fail> counds are the complement of "OK" counts.
#	A common example of a failed SQL code would "23503" foreign key
#	violation, indicated a bug in the etc/*.flow file.
#	
#  Usage:
#	run-stat | ... sort | ... column
#
#	while sleep 60;  do
#		run-stat | put-to-db
#	done
#  See:
#	run-stat-report
#  Note:
#	Really, really, really need to move the files in log/*.{qdr,xdr,fdr}
#	to directory data/ or spool/!
#
#	Probing process existence with pgrep might be useful.
#	Not clear if another script should do this.

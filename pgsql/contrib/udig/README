Synopsis:
	A UDig data type is a tagged crypto digest for sha and bitcoin wallet.
Description:
	The UDig data type in PostgreSQL implements tagged crypto digests.
	Currently, digests SHA1 and the BitCoin 160 bit wallet are supported.

	FOr example, a sha digest is tagged as

		sha:bb37250a701a6b8ed28cbc0868ece2e07919a711

	and the bit coin digest is tagged as

		bc160:c61f7c22a6d42bb84a5f43dd2b44a366d7d79bc7

	The bc160 is equal to the openssl digest
	
		openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | openssl dgst -ripemd160 -r

Usage:
	make USE_PGXS=1 install
	psql <database> -f $PGHOME/share/contrib/udig.sql
Note:
	Can this data type be rewritten in SQL only?

	Convert this to an extension, damn it!

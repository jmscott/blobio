Synopsis:
	Flow blob request records into a directed acylic graph of processes and SQL queries

Description:
	While reading blob request records the flowd server will order the
	execution of unix process or database queries by qualifying on the
	exit status or query results.  The purpose of flowd is to derive
	immutable facts about the blobs scanned on the input stream,
	starting with unix processes than analyze the blobs and ending with
	facts populated into a relational database.

	The design inspiration of flowd is a mashup of the famous unix commands
	"make" and "awk".  The process/query order is syntacally a directed
	acyclic graph.  The side affects of the invoked unix processes/queries
	is hidden from flowd, other than the exit status or query results.

	The invocation of a particular process is determined by
	qualifying on the exit status of older processes in the the
	same flow.  A flow on a particular brr tuple will always
	terminate, since the call order is a DAG.  However,
	infinite loops are possible for processes that always reread a
	blob, thus generating more brr records.

	Flows are independent of other flows.  In other words, the
	results of a particular flow can not be referenced with in flowd by
	a different flow. Such logical independence yields natural parallelism.

Flow Detail Record:
	A flow detail record, named a "fdr", summarizes the outcome
	of invoking a set of related calls, a "flow", on a particular blob
	request record.

	The format of an "fdr" is the typical unixy new-line separated row
	of tab separated fields.  The layout of the fields are as follows:

		start_time		#  YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ns9 [+-]0000
		udig			#  udig of the blob
		ok_count		#  count of ok process exits <=2^63-1
		fault_count		#  count of process faults <=2^63-1
		wall_duration		#  wall clock duration seconds.nsec
		sequence		#  service flow sequence, <= 2^63 - 1 

	The combination of "start_time" and "sequence" can safely be assumed to
	be unique for records associated with this service.  Unfortunatly, in
	theory, the uniqueness constraint could be violated by EXTREMELY rapid
	process bouncing.

	The total number of processing events in the flow is ok_count +
	fault_count.  Currently the flows only fire executable programs;
	eventually, queries, forwarding a brr and, possibly, cache inquires
	will become events within a flow.

	ok and fault count are uint8.

	Wall duration is float64 seconds formated as %20.9f.

Process Execution Detail Record:
	A process execution detail record, abbreviated as "xdr", summarizes
	the outcome of calling a particular command on a particular blob.

	The format of an "xdr" is the typical unixy new-line separated row
	of tab separated fields.  The layout of the fields are as follows:

		start_time		#  YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ns9 [+-]ZZZZ
		flow_sequence		#  service flow sequence
		command_name		#  command name in config file
		termination_class	#  termination class: OK, ERR, SIG, NOPS
		udig			#  blob udig
		termination_code	#  process/signal/query exit code value
		wall_duration		#  wall clock duration in seconds
		system_duration		#  os duration in seconds
		user_duration		#  user/kids total duration in seconds

	The combination of start_time, call_name and flow_sequence  can
	safely assumed to be unique, although, in theory, uniqueness could be
	compromised by EXTREMELY rapid process bouncing.  See comment for "fdr"
	
	The NOPS termination class indicates a failure to determine the process
	status.  Typically a NOPS means the process never started.

	Wall/System/Users duration is float64 seconds formated as %20.9f.

Query Detail Record:

	A query detail record, abbreviated as "qdr", summarizes the
	invocation of an sql database query 

		start_time		#  YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ns9 [+-]ZZZZ
		flow_sequence		#  service flow sequence
		query_name		#  name of query, unique across flow
		termination_class	#  termination class: OK, ERR
		udig			#  blob udig
		sqlstate		#  sql termination state
		rows_affected		#  Rows fetched/merged/updated
		wall_duration		#  wall clock duration as seconds
		query_duration		#  db query duration as seconds

	As with the "xdr" records, uniqueness can be determined by start_time,
	flow_sequence and query_name.

	Wall/Query durations are float64 seconds formated as %20.9f.

Note:
	- change tail{} to inbound{} and outbound{}.

	- add to command{}

		exit_status is true;
		exit_status is null;

	  to force always true and always null.  always null effectively
	  disabled a command.

	- think about an idle{} block added to flow language.  idle{}
	  would execute code when no brr tuples are flowing

	- should [fxq]dr logs be rolled on flow boundaries?

	- think about defaulting to single defined database{} in query{}
	  statements, thus eliminating the redundant 'database is ...'
	  statement.

	- think about how to handle sql database restarts.

	- should the statement 'exit_status is OK when ...' be rewritten like
	  OK when exit_status in {...}' for a more query like syntax?

	- unfortunatly the flow language is ascii only, except for strings.
	  being ascii only, particualr in command and query names, makes
	  identifying exec and query detail records much easier, at the cost
	  of completness.  investigate the meaning of the functions
	  golang.unicode.IsLetter() and glolang.unicode.IsDigit().
	  if command/query names are allowed to be full unicode, then maybe a
	  field like ascii_name = "..." ought to be required in the definition.

	- insure that tail, command & sql query ascii names match the pattern
	  ^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,63}$.

	- verify that all 64 bit counts and sequences are no bigger than
	  2^63 - 1

	- log when a tailed file rolls.

	- Why is the statement 'database is ...' required in the query
	  definition?  when the statement is missing why not just default to
	  the only database defined previously in the file?

	- Should the statement 'sql query <name> row' be 
	  'sql query row <name>'>?  Also, what changing the
	  'result row is(answer bool)' to 'result row is(answer in bool)'

	- does flowing {bool,string,ui64}_value full structures instead
	  of pointers lessen garbage collection overhead.

	- think about a channel that traces i/o, possibly using reflection.

	- What about a daily summary of the rrd stats, written as the
	  last line and the first line of every rolled log file.

	  distinct udigs ought to be tracked in stats in log file.
	  also, maximum number of open queries.

	- On every daily log roll, add dump of environment variables and
	  any other bootup configs that dumped upon startup to newly
	  rolled log file.

	- If rolling a log file for which a boot up occured, then
	  write the sha of that file into next log file.

	- Should flowd serialize the firing of flow to a particular brr?
	  For example, suppose the following 2 brr records.

		10:00:00am	sha:abc ...	eat==no
		10:00:01am	sha:abc ...	put==yes

	  if the 10:00:00am eat fires after the 10:00:01 put, then
	  could that problematic.  ordering for a single udig may help
	  for independent facts about that udig, but will it help for
	  interelated facts, like graph dependency?  not so clear.

	- Think about adding code to catch runaways; i.e, commands that keep
	  failing to frequently.  Another approach penalize blobs which keep
	  reappearing via separate queues or weights.

	- randomize the initial flow sequence value

#  Synopsis:
#	Makefile Template for typical Mac OSX >= 10.6
#  Description:
#	Template for local make environment under Mac OSX >= 10.6
#
#	Examine and possbily edit the following variables:
#
#		DIST_ROOT	Where to install full blobio distribution;
#				  e.g., /usr/local/blobio for production or
#				  $HOME/opt/blobio for development.
#		OPENSSL_INC	Where ssl include files live
#		OPENSSL_LIB	Link line for openssl libraries
#
#		GODIST		Where is go distribution installed.
#					Redefining GOROOT is problematic,
#					hence GODIST
#		
#  Usage:
#	cp local-macosx.mk.example local.mk
#	vi local.mk
#	make install
#  Note:
#	Xcode8 is broken on El Capitan (10.11).  In particular, a reference to
#	clock_gettime() exists, so the complication succeeds, but no underlying
#	library for clock_gettime() exists, so the run time link fails.
#	Never ends.

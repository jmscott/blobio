#  Synopsis:
#	Summarize stats and duration in run/{flowd,bio4d}.{pid,gyr} files.
#  Description:
#  	Flowd|bio4d processes can be in one of five states:
#
#		UP 	=> running as expected.
#		DOWN	=> is not running but is expected to be online (OK)
#		ZOMBI	=> process is supposed be dead but appears alive
#		YETI	=> process is supposed to be alive but no updates
#		OFFL	=> process is intentionally off line (cleanly)
#
#	The stats accumulated are since boot and the most recent sample.
#	Typically samples are every 10 seconds.  Green/Yellow/Red exist
#	for both the boot and recent samples.
#
#	This script folds the above values into a single, tab-separated tuple.
#	suitable for easy parsing by shell scripts and what-not.
#
#		[bio4d|flowd|flowd>remote]				\
#		[UP|DOWN|ZOMBI|YETI|OFFL]]				\
#		<boot-epoch>						\
#			<boot-green>	<boot-yellow>	<boot-red>	\
#		<recent-epoch>						\
#			<recent-green>	<recent-yellow>	<recent-red>	\
#
#	Here is an example tuple for the flowd process
#
#		flowd\tUP\1630547570\t1080\t0\t01630884910t275\t0\t0
#
#	<green> is the count of correct requests, <yellow> the count
#	of worrisome requests which may impact service and <red> is the
#	count of requests which do impact service.
#
#	See the individual processes for the meaning of green,yellow,red.

#
#  Usage:
#	export BLOBIO_ROOT=$HOME/opt/blobio
#	run-stat-tuple | ... sort | ... column
#
#	while sleep 60;  do
#		run-stat | put-to-db
#	done
#  See:
#	run-stat-report
#  Note:
#	Consider a process state OFFLINE for disabled sync remote services,
#	by checking for existence of sync/root/<remote>/etc/sync-<remote>.flow.
#
#	Really, really, really need to move the files in log/*.{qdr,xdr,fdr}
#	to directory data/ or spool/!
#

STALE_AFTER=61		#  need to derive heartbeat values in etc/profile

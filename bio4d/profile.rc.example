#
#  The script 'bio4d' consults $BLOBIO_SERVICE to change the port from the
#  default port of 1797 to a different port. For example, a development server
#  might listen on port 1796.
#
#  $BLOBIO_BIO4D_PORT is not used by any client software.
#
#  Note:
#  	The bio4d script outght to derive the port from $BLOBIO_SERVICE.
#  	Defining a second variable is stupid.
#
#export BLOBIO_BIO4D_PORT=1797

#
#  To enable logging of bio4d stats then set BLOBIO_BIO4D_RRD_DURATION > 0sec.
#  Stats appear in $BLOBIO_ROOT/run/bio4d.rrd.  0 disables.
#
#export BLOBIO_BIO4D_RRD_DURATION=0

#
#  To change read/write timeout in seconds.
#
#  This is not a timeout for entire blob request.
#  Hardcoded default is 20 seconds.
#
#export BLOBIO_BIO4D_NET_TIMEOUT=60
